                <h2>How to start ?</h2>
                <p>
                    In this whole C++ tutorial, you will be learning about writing C++ programs. But what after that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    After writing any program, we need to <b>compile</b> and <b>run</b> it to see the output of the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what is meant by compiling ?
                </p><p>
                    When we write our program in C++ language, it needs to be converted to machine language (which is binary language consisting of 0s and 1s) so that computer can understand and execute it. This conversion is known as compiling a program. We compile a code with the help of a compiler.
                </p>
                <h3>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3>
                <p>
                    To write and compile our C++ program, we have been provided with many IDEs.
                </p><p>
                    An IDE consists of a <b>Text Editor</b> as well as a <b>Compiler</b>. We type our program in the text editor which is then  compiled by the compiler.
                </p><h4>Text Editor</h4>
                <p>
                    We write our program in a text editor. The file containing our program is called <b>source file</b> and is saved with a <b>.cpp</b> extension.
                </p><h4>C++ Compiler</h4><hr>
                <p>
                    After saving our program in a file with the .cpp extension, we need to compile it to convert it into machine language that computer can understand.
                </p><p>
                    Now let's see how to compile and execute a C++ program on different operating systems.
                </p><h3>Writing and compiling C++ program on Windows</h3><hr>
                <p>
                    Though there are many IDEs available for editing and compiling C++ programs for Windows, here we are talking about editing and compiling program using <b>DevC++</b> which allows us to edit, compile and run our program. We can write and save our program using DevC++ itself and then compile it using the same.
                </p><p>
                    Before learning to write a program in DevC++, first, make sure it is installed in your computer. If not, then download and install it.
                </p><p>
                    To write and compile in DevC++, follow the steps given below.
                </p><p>
                    1. On opening DevC++, you will get a window. Click on File-&gt;New-&gt;Source File option.
                </p><p>
                        2. 	Write your C++ program as shown below and save it ( <b>ctrl+s</b> ).
                    </p><div class="row">

                           <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
                        <span class="p">}</span>
                        </pre></div>
                        </div>

                        </div><div>
                            <p>
                                3. 	Once you have written the program, click on compile and run.
                            </p><p>
                                4. 	An output window will appear showing the result that is, <b>Hello World</b> printed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, you are ready to go for the next chapter. We will explain this code in the next chapter.

                            <p>
                                For Linux, you can write your C++ program in various text editors like vim, gedit or Emacs. The following steps show how to edit and compile your C++ program, assuming that the text editor is gedit.
                            </p><p>
                                1. Open Terminal ( <b>ctrl+alt+T</b> ).
                            </p><p>
                                2. Open a new file with <b>.cpp</b> extension ( in our case name of the file is hello.cpp ) in your favourite editor (in our case <b>gedit</b>). The command is :
                        
                            </p><p><b>gedit hello.cpp</b>
                            </p><p>
                                3. The text editor window will be opened. Type the C++ program given below ( we will explain this code in the next chapter ) and save it.
                            </p><p>
                                4. To compile the program, type <b>g++ hello.cpp -o hello</b> ( <b>g++ filename.cpp -o hello</b> ) and press Enter. This will create an executable file with name 'hello' ( you can give any other name also but you will have to execute the file with that name only ).
                            </p><p>
                                5. To run your program, type <b>./hello</b> ( 'hello' is the name of the executable file we created in step 4 ) and press Enter. This will show the output of your program.
                            </p><p>
                                You can see <b>Hello World</b> printed on your screen. Now, you know how to write and compile C++ codes. So, you can go to the next chapter to understand this code.
